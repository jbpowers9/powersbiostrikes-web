      "1/ The problem with biotech \"gurus\": They show you the wins and bury the losses. No accountability. No edge verification.\n\nI got tired of it. So I built a system that forces transparency - starting with my own money.",
      "2/ My approach uses 3 pillars:\n\n- Expected Net Return (ENR): Monte Carlo simulations across 10K scenarios\n- Kelly Criterion: Mathematical position sizing based on edge\n- CONT Score: Predicting post-catalyst continuation vs sell-the-news\n\nNo gut feel. Pure math.",
      "3/ The numbers so far:\n\n- 54 trades across 29 biotechs\n- 68.5% win rate\n- 176% annualized return\n\nEvery position timestamped. Losses shown prominently. Because that's how you build trust.",

    "thread_parts": [
      "1/ A drug can have 85% approval odds but TERRIBLE options.\n\nWhy? Because the market already priced it in. The IV is juiced. The premiums are insane.\n\nENR captures this. It's not just probability - it's probability * payoff - premium - IV crush.",
      "2/ I run 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations per strike.\n\nEach sim models:\n- Random approval/rejection (weighted by historical base rates)\n- Stock move magnitude (adjusted for market cap, indication, phase)\n- IV crush impact (50-70% for binary events)\n- Time decay\n\nThen I average them all.",
      "3/ My entry threshold: 140% ENR minimum.\n\nThis means I expect to more than DOUBLE my money on average across thousands of similar trades.\n\nBelow 140%? I pass. Even if the thesis is great.\n\nMath over hype.",

    "content": "\"Buy the rumor, sell the news\" kills biotech traders.\n\nA drug gets APPROVED and the stock... drops?\n\nThat's why I built the CONT score - to predict which approvals RUN vs which get dumped. Here's how:\n\n[THREAD]",
    "thread_parts": [
      "1/ CONT (Continuation Score) predicts post-catalyst price action.\n\nFactors that drive continuation:\n- First-in-class drug (new mechanism)\n- Critical unmet medical need\n- Orphan drug status\n- Multiple future catalysts\n- Price momentum into event",
      "2/ Factors that kill continuation:\n- Already priced in (stock ran 100%+)\n- Me-too drug (competitors exist)\n- Single indication (no pipeline optionality)\n- Heavy insider selling\n\nI weight each factor and generate a 0-100 score.",
      "3/ Score interpretation:\n\n80+ = HOLD through catalyst (expect continuation)\n50-79 = Tight exit plan (take profits quick)\n<50 = Exit BEFORE catalyst fully prices in\n\nThis saved me from multiple \"approval dumps.\"",
      "4/ Example: $CRMD has CONT score of 90.\n\nWhy? Already profitable, 21% short interest (squeeze fuel), orphan drug, multiple indications.\n\nThis is a \"hold through\" setup, not a \"sell the news\" trap.\n\nMore at powersbiostrikes.com"
